# DevOps Lab Setup: Connected Workflow Showcase

This document showcases my journey in creating a fully integrated DevOps lab environment, using a variety of DevOps tools to achieve a production-like, resilient system.

## Step-by-Step DevOps Lab Setup: Connected Workflow

### Step 1: Set Up the Infrastructure with Terraform (Provisioning)
**Objective**: Use Terraform to provision the base infrastructure for the lab.

**Action**:
- Defined the infrastructure in Terraform (e.g., VMs for the web server, database, and CI/CD server).
- Created a `main.tf` file that specifies the VMs, networking, and security groups.
- Ran `terraform init` and `terraform apply` to deploy the environment.

**Key Connection**: This base infrastructure provides a consistent foundation for all other steps, ensuring that VMs are networked properly.

---

### Step 2: Configure VMs with Ansible (Automation & Consistency)
**Objective**: Use Ansible to automate the installation and configuration of services on the VMs.

**Action**:
- Created an Ansible inventory listing Terraform-provisioned VMs.
- Wrote playbooks to install services according to each VM's role:
  - Web server: Installed NGINX, PHP, etc.
  - Database server: Installed MySQL or PostgreSQL.
  - CI/CD server: Installed Jenkins.
- Ran Ansible playbooks to configure all VMs.

**Key Connection**: Ansible ensures that each machine is consistently configured, reducing manual setup and providing environment-wide uniformity.

---

### Step 3: Set Up Jenkins for CI/CD (Automation Integration)
**Objective**: Set up Jenkins to automate build, test, and deployment processes.

**Action**:
- Accessed the Jenkins VM (created in Step 1, configured in Step 2).
- Installed Docker, GitHub, Ansible, and Terraform plugins.
- Created a Jenkins pipeline to:
  - Pull code from Git.
  - Build Docker images.
  - Deploy the image to the web server.
- Configured Jenkins for automatic triggers on Git pushes.

**Key Connection**: Jenkins forms the core of the CI/CD process, enabling automatic build and deployment on code changes.

---

### Step 4: Containerize the Application with Docker (Isolation & Portability)
**Objective**: Use Docker for containerization, ensuring consistency across environments.

**Action**:
- Created a Dockerfile in the app repository.
- Configured Jenkins to build and push the Docker image to a private Docker registry.
- Used Docker Compose to define services (web server, database).
- Deployed Docker containers on the web server VM.

**Key Connection**: Containerization ensures the app runs reliably regardless of the environment, with Jenkins managing Docker builds.

---

### Step 5: Orchestrate with Kubernetes (Scalability & Reliability)
**Objective**: Deploy and manage Dockerized applications with Kubernetes.

**Action**:
- Set up a Kubernetes cluster using kubeadm.
- Created Kubernetes manifests (e.g., deployment, service files) to define app runtime.
- Updated the Jenkins pipeline to deploy to Kubernetes.
- Configured auto-scaling and load balancing with Kubernetes.

**Key Connection**: Kubernetes provides scaling, redundancy, and resilience, making the app scalable and highly available.

---

### Step 6: Implement Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana (Visibility & Metrics)
**Objective**: Monitor infrastructure, services, and applications.

**Action**:
- Installed Prometheus (via Ansible) for metrics scraping.
- Configured Prometheus to scrape metrics from the Kubernetes cluster.
- Installed Grafana and created dashboards for visual insights.
- Set up Grafana alerts (e.g., high CPU usage, pod failures).

**Key Connection**: Monitoring provides system health visibility, allowing proactive troubleshooting and response.

---

### Step 7: Centralize Logging with ELK Stack (Visibility & Debugging)
**Objective**: Establish centralized logging for VMs and containers.

**Action**:
- Installed Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK) on one VM.
- Configured Logstash to collect logs from all VMs and containers using Filebeat.
- Set up Kibana for log visualization and troubleshooting.

**Key Connection**: Centralized logging unifies all logs, aiding in debugging and system analysis.

---

### Step 8: Secure Your Infrastructure (Security & Compliance)
**Objective**: Implement security measures across the environment.

**Action**:
- Configured a firewall using Ansible to manage traffic.
- Installed SSL certificates on the web server.
- Configured Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) for restricted access.
- Performed regular vulnerability scans.

**Key Connection**: Security layers protect each part of the environment, ensuring compliance and reducing risk.

---

### Step 9: Automate Backups and Disaster Recovery (Reliability & Resilience)
**Objective**: Set up automated backup solutions for resilience.

**Action**:
- Automated backups for databases and applications using Ansible.
- Stored backups in a remote location (e.g., cloud storage).
- Simulated disaster recovery to ensure the system could restore from backups.

**Key Connection**: Automated backups and recovery processes improve system resilience.

---

### Step 10: Load Balancing and Auto-Scaling (High Availability)
**Objective**: Achieve high availability and scalability.

**Action**:
- Configured NGINX or HAProxy for load balancing across web server VMs or Kubernetes pods.
- Enabled auto-scaling in Kubernetes to handle varying traffic.
- Set up health checks to reroute traffic if any instance fails.

**Key Connection**: Load balancing ensures availability, while auto-scaling manages increased load dynamically.

## Final Outcome: Fully Integrated DevOps Lab

This lab demonstrates my understanding of DevOps practices and tools, including:

- **Provisioned Infrastructure**: Using Terraform.
- **Automated Configuration**: Using Ansible.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: With Jenkins.
- **Containerized Applications**: Using Docker.
- **Orchestrated Deployment**: Using Kubernetes.
- **Comprehensive Monitoring and Logging**: With Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack.
- **High Availability, Security, and Resilience**: Through load balancing, backups, and security automation.

This journey provided me with hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of building, securing, and maintaining a production-ready DevOps environment.
