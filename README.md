## <span style="color: red;">üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step DevOps Lab Setup: Connected Workflow</span>

### <span style="color: red;">Step 1: Set Up the Infrastructure with Terraform (Provisioning)</span> üèóÔ∏è
- **Objective**: Use Terraform to provision the base infrastructure for the lab.
- **Action**:
  - [ ] Define the infrastructure in Terraform (e.g., VMs for web server, database, and CI/CD server).
  - [ ] Create a `main.tf` file specifying VMs, networking, and security groups.
  - [ ] Run `terraform init` and `terraform apply` to deploy the environment.
- **Key Connection**: This forms the base infrastructure for all subsequent steps, ensuring that VMs are up and networked properly.

### <span style="color: red;">Step 2: Configure VMs with Ansible (Automation & Consistency)</span> üîÑ
- **Objective**: Use Ansible to automate the installation and configuration of services on the VMs.
- **Action**:
  - [ ] Create an Ansible inventory listing Terraform-provisioned VMs (e.g., web, DB, CI/CD servers).
  - Write playbooks to install necessary services:
    - [ ] **Web server VM**: Install NGINX, PHP, etc.
    - [ ] **DB server VM**: Install MySQL or PostgreSQL.
    - [ ] **CI/CD VM**: Install Jenkins.
  - [ ] Run Ansible playbooks to configure all VMs.
- **Key Connection**: Ansible ensures all machines are consistently configured, minimizing manual intervention and maintaining uniformity.

### <span style="color: red;">Step 3: Set Up Jenkins for CI/CD (Automation Integration)</span> üß©
- **Objective**: Set up Jenkins to automate build, test, and deployment processes.
- **Action**:
  - [ ] Access the Jenkins VM (created in Step 1, configured in Step 2).
  - [ ] Install required plugins for Docker, GitHub, Ansible, and Terraform.
  - Create a Jenkins pipeline to:
    - [ ] Pull code from a Git repository.
    - [ ] Build a Docker image.
    - [ ] Deploy the image to the web server VM.
  - [ ] Configure Jenkins to trigger on every Git push (via webhooks or polling).
- **Key Connection**: Jenkins brings the entire CI/CD process together, automating code-to-deployment steps for streamlined updates.

## üåü <span style="color: red;">Final Outcome: Fully Integrated DevOps Lab</span>
By following these steps, this lab setup demonstrates the practical application of DevOps tools, resulting in:
- **Provisioned Infrastructure** with Terraform.
- **Automated Configuration** using Ansible.
- **CI/CD Pipelines** managed by Jenkins.
- **Containerized Applications** with Docker.
- **Scalable Orchestration** via Kubernetes.
- **Full Monitoring & Logging** with Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK.
- **High Availability, Security, and Resilience** through load balancing, backups, and security automation.

Each step highlights and consolidates my knowledge and practical experience in DevOps, showcasing a robust, production-ready environment.
